# Task 01

A YouTube streamer decided to conduct a survey where users were asked to provide feedback on what they would like to watch in the next stream. Your job is to create a program that uses the following information and prints out the result of what the user chose, along with a thank you message.

```text
What shall I stream next?

a) Days Gone
b) Resident Evil 2
c) Fortnite
d) Apex Legends
e) Death Stranding
f) Surprise Us!

The ending message should be:

You have chosen (option). I appreciate your time and hope to see you at the next one!
```

The exercise is fairly simple. Most of these will require you to print out information and then store the user-input value. Design the program so that it can understand what 'a' or 'b' or any character that the user chooses is, and then print the same out in the end greetings. You do not have to worry about printing out the name in the end. Just the letter of the selection will do for now.
