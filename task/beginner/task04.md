# Task 04

A dentist wishes to have a program created for his website where the customers will be presented with multiple services. The customer will choose the option and will be presented with a total for the service that is payable by the customer. The services are given as shown below:

- a) Root Canal Therapy - $250
- b) Oral Hygiene Check - $50
- c) Emergency Injury Treatment - $100
- d) Post-Procedure Check-up - $150
- e) Routine Check-ups and Consultation - $75

For advanced payments, customers get a 50% discount.

Design a program that provides the customer with all the necessary information and gives a total according to what the customer chooses.

Confused? Let me give you a hint. You cannot store two values within a single variable unless you intend to create a list here. We are not aiming for that. You can either create two separate variables, service_a and price_a, or you can simply use conditional statements to further enhance the program. I leave the decision up to you.

I would prefer to use the latter though. It is a lot easier and less messy in nature.
