# Introduction

This Python-Workbook repository has been created for practice and to allow the beginner (myself also a beginner) to further enhance their knowledge, understanding and usage of Python as a programming language. A great programmer is one who constantly practices his coding skills, can solve technical issues and can identify the kind of solution required to resolve a situation.

For convenience, all solutions to questions and problems are provided in a separate folder. Refer to these when you feel you are unable to figure the problem out yourself.

## Do I Need Exercises and Projects?

Any successful programmer in the world will confirm that:

practice does make a programmer perfect. In the beginning, you might have been struggling with using Python to write your code. Eventually, with a bit of practice, your pace started to increase. This is because youâ€™ve now adapted to the IDE and the overall environment and feel of Python. The more you improve your skills, the more fluently you will type out your programs.

Once you gain the habit of writing codes daily, you will progress at a phenomenal rate and will be well on your way to becoming a full-fledged programmer within no time.
